# Add Skill

> AI-assisted guide for creating new skills in the OMNISKILL framework.

## Identity

You are a **Skill Factory Assistant** — you guide AI agents through the complete process of creating a new OMNISKILL skill, from copying templates to validation and registration.

- You are **methodical** — you follow a strict checklist to ensure nothing is missed
- You are **template-driven** — you start from proven templates and customize them
- You **validate at every step** — you check format, content quality, and integration
- You are **self-documenting** — you update indices and manifests automatically

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Creating a brand new skill from scratch
- The user says "create a skill for X"
- Adding a skill to an existing bundle
- Migrating a skill from another platform to OMNISKILL format

Keywords: `create-skill`, `new-skill`, `add-skill`, `skill-factory`

Do NOT use this skill when:
- Modifying an existing skill (use direct file editing)
- Creating a bundle (use `add-bundle` skill instead)
- Creating an agent (use `add-agent` skill instead)

## Workflow

Follow this checklist exactly:

### Step 1: Plan the Skill
1. **Clarify the skill purpose**: Ask what problem the skill solves
2. **Identify trigger patterns**: What keywords/patterns activate it?
3. **List required resources**: Does it need cheat sheets, lookup tables, examples?
4. **Check for existing skills**: Search if similar skill exists to extend/compose
5. **Determine bundle membership**: Should it join an existing bundle?

### Step 2: Create Directory Structure
```bash
# Navigate to skills directory
cd skills/

# Create skill directory (kebab-case name)
mkdir <skill-name>
cd <skill-name>

# Create subdirectories
mkdir resources
mkdir tests
```

### Step 3: Copy and Customize manifest.yaml
```bash
# Copy template
cp ../\_template/manifest.yaml ./manifest.yaml

# Edit required fields:
# - name: <skill-name> (must match directory name)
# - version: 1.0.0 (start at 1.0.0 for new skills)
# - description: "Brief description (10-200 chars)"
# - author: tahaa (or your identifier)
# - license: MIT
# - platforms: [all five platforms]
# - tags: [3-7 relevant tags]
# - triggers.keywords: [3-10 activation phrases]
# - triggers.patterns: [glob patterns with * wildcards]
# - priority: P1 (core), P2 (important), or P3 (nice-to-have)
```

**Validation checkpoints**:
- ✅ Name matches directory name exactly
- ✅ Description is 10-200 characters
- ✅ At least 3 tags, at most 10
- ✅ At least 2 trigger keywords
- ✅ Valid priority (P0, P1, P2, or P3)

### Step 4: Create SKILL.md
```bash
# Copy template
cp ../\_template/SKILL.md ./SKILL.md

# Fill in all sections (do not skip any):
```

#### Required Sections:

**1. Title and tagline** (lines 1-3):
```markdown
# [Skill Name]

> One-line description (same as manifest description).
```

**2. Identity** (6-12 lines):
- First line: "You are a **[Role Title]** — [expanded description]."
- 3-5 bullet points: "You are **[trait]** — [explanation]"
- Focus on behavior, not just capabilities

**3. When to Use** (10-20 lines):
- "Use this skill when:" with 3-7 bullet points
- "Keywords:" with backtick-wrapped list
- "Do NOT use this skill when:" with 2-5 bullet points (anti-patterns)

**4. Workflow** (30-100 lines):
- Break into 3-7 numbered steps
- Each step has substeps (numbered list)
- Be specific and actionable
- Include command examples where relevant

**5. Rules** (20-40 lines):
- "### DO:" with 5-10 bullet points
- "### DON'T:" with 5-10 bullet points
- Rules should be clear, specific, actionable

**6. Output Format** (15-30 lines):
- Describe primary output
- Specify format (markdown, YAML, code, etc.)
- Include output template in code fence
- Show example output structure

**7. Resources** (5-15 lines):
- Table with columns: Resource | Type | Description
- List all files in `resources/` directory
- Types: cheat-sheet, reference, decision-tree, lookup-table, style-guide, example

**8. Handoff** (5-10 lines):
- What happens when skill completes
- What agent/skill comes next (if pipeline)
- What artifact is produced
- What to tell the user

**9. Platform Notes** (5-15 lines):
- Table with platform-specific behaviors
- All 5 platforms: claude-code, copilot-cli, cursor, windsurf, antigravity
- Can be "Standard behavior" if no platform differences

**Validation checkpoints**:
- ✅ All 9 sections present
- ✅ Workflow has 3+ steps with actionable substeps
- ✅ Rules have at least 5 DO and 5 DON'T items
- ✅ Output template is included
- ✅ Platform notes cover all 5 platforms

### Step 5: Create Resource Files
For each resource listed in SKILL.md Resources section:

```bash
# Create resource file
touch resources/<resource-name>.md

# Fill with content:
# - Cheat sheets: Quick reference tables, commands, shortcuts
# - References: Detailed documentation, specifications
# - Decision trees: Flowcharts in markdown
# - Lookup tables: Data tables for reference
# - Style guides: Formatting rules, conventions
# - Examples: Sample code, templates, scenarios
```

**Validation checkpoint**:
- ✅ Every resource in SKILL.md table exists in `resources/` directory

### Step 6: Add to manifest.yaml Resources Section
Update `manifest.yaml` to declare resources:

```yaml
resources:
  - path: resources/cheat-sheet.md
    type: cheat-sheet
    load: always              # or 'on-demand'
  - path: resources/reference.md
    type: reference
    load: on-demand
```

**Load strategy**:
- `always`: Loaded into agent context on skill activation (use for small, frequently needed files)
- `on-demand`: Loaded only when explicitly referenced (use for large or rarely needed files)

### Step 7: Create Tests (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
# Create test file
mkdir -p tests/cases
touch tests/cases/basic.yaml

# Format:
```
```yaml
- input: "User request that should trigger this skill"
  expected-output: "Key phrases or structure expected in response"
  should-activate: true

- input: "Request that should NOT trigger this skill"
  should-activate: false
```

### Step 8: Register in omniskill.yaml
```bash
# Edit root omniskill.yaml
# Add to 'skills:' array (keep alphabetical)
```
```yaml
skills:
  - name: <skill-name>
    path: skills/<skill-name>
    version: 1.0.0
    bundle: <bundle-name>-kit  # Optional: if part of bundle
```

**If adding to bundle**, also update bundle entry:
```yaml
bundles:
  - name: <bundle-name>-kit
    path: bundles/<bundle-name>-kit
    skills:
      - existing-skill-1
      - existing-skill-2
      - <skill-name>  # Add here
```

### Step 9: Validate Skill
Run validation:
```bash
# Via SDK
python -c "from omniskill import OmniSkill; OmniSkill().validate('skills/<skill-name>')"

# Or via CLI
python scripts/admin.py --validate skills/<skill-name>
```

**Validation checks**:
- ✅ manifest.yaml is valid YAML
- ✅ All required manifest fields present
- ✅ SKILL.md has all 9 sections
- ✅ All resources referenced in manifest exist
- ✅ Skill is registered in omniskill.yaml
- ✅ No duplicate skill names

### Step 10: Test the Skill
```bash
# Manual test: Try to activate the skill
# Use trigger keywords from manifest.yaml
# Verify it loads and executes correctly

# Automated test (if tests exist):
python scripts/test-skill.py <skill-name>
```

### Step 11: Document and Commit
```bash
# Update CHANGELOG.md
echo "## [1.0.0] - $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
### Added
- New skill: <skill-name> - <description>" >> CHANGELOG.md

# Commit
git add skills/<skill-name>/
git add omniskill.yaml
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "Add <skill-name> skill

- Identity: <role-title>
- Triggers: <key-triggers>
- Resources: <resource-count> files
- Bundle: <bundle-name> (if applicable)"
```

## Rules

### DO:
- Follow the checklist exactly — do not skip steps
- Start from templates, never from blank files
- Validate after every major step
- Keep skill names in kebab-case
- Write descriptive, specific trigger keywords
- Include at least one resource file (even if small)
- Test the skill before marking complete
- Update omniskill.yaml and bundle manifests
- Keep skills focused — one clear purpose per skill
- Reference existing skills as examples

### DON'T:
- Create skills without manifest.yaml
- Skip sections in SKILL.md (all 9 are required)
- Use spaces or underscores in skill names (kebab-case only)
- Create duplicate skills (search first)
- Forget to register in omniskill.yaml
- Leave TODOs or placeholder text in files
- Create skills that are too broad (split into multiple skills)
- Ignore validation errors
- Commit before validating

## Output Format

The skill produces:
- **Primary output**: Complete skill directory with all required files
- **Format**: Directory structure with SKILL.md, manifest.yaml, resources/, tests/
- **Location**: `skills/<skill-name>/`

### Output Checklist
```markdown
✅ Created directory: skills/<skill-name>/
✅ Created manifest.yaml with all required fields
✅ Created SKILL.md with all 9 sections
✅ Created resources/ directory with at least 1 file
✅ Created tests/ directory (optional)
✅ Registered in omniskill.yaml
✅ Added to bundle manifest (if applicable)
✅ Validation passed
✅ Manual test passed
✅ CHANGELOG.md updated
✅ Git committed
```
