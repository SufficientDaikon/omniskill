## 🎨 Design

The documentation uses the same stunning design system as the main OMNISKILL page:

- **Dark theme** with glassmorphism effects
- **Gradient accents** (blue → cyan → purple)
- **Inter + JetBrains Mono** fonts from Google Fonts
- **Smooth animations** and scroll effects
- **Responsive design** — works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Left sidebar navigation** with all doc pages
- **Beautiful code blocks** with syntax-like styling
- **Interactive elements** — FAQ accordions, hover effects

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Open any `.html` file in a browser
2. Navigate using the left sidebar
3. Use breadcrumbs to track your location
4. Enjoy the beautiful, readable documentation!

## 🔧 Customization

All styles are in `styles.css`. To customize:

- **Colors**: Edit CSS variables in `:root`
- **Fonts**: Change Google Fonts import in each HTML file
- **Layout**: Adjust `.doc-content`, `.sidebar`, etc.
- **Components**: Modify `.content-section`, `.code-block`, etc.

## 📝 Content Sources

Documentation content is derived from the markdown files in this directory:

- `getting-started.md` → `getting-started.html`
- `creating-skills.md` → `creating-skills.html`
- (and so on for all pages)

## ✨ Features

- ✓ Glassmorphism sidebar with blur effects
- ✓ Terminal-style code blocks with green prompts
- ✓ Step indicators with numbered circles
- ✓ File tree visualization

## 🌐 Live Preview

To preview locally, just open any HTML file in your browser. No server needed!

For a live server with hot reload:

```bash
# Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Node.js
npx serve

# VS Code Live Server extension
# Right-click HTML file → Open with Live Server
```

Then visit: `http://localhost:8000/getting-started.html`

## 📦 Building HTML Documentation

The HTML documentation is auto-generated from the Markdown files in this directory using `scripts/build_docs.py`:

```bash
python scripts/build_docs.py
```

This generates styled HTML files in `docs/html/` with:

- Dark GitHub-inspired theme
- Mermaid.js diagram rendering (ASCII art is auto-converted to Mermaid)
- Sidebar navigation across all pages
- Responsive mobile-friendly layout

Output: `docs/html/` directory with one HTML file per Markdown doc.

### Deploying

The HTML files are static — deploy them to:

- GitHub Pages (recommended: serve from `docs/html/`)
- Netlify
- Vercel
- Any static hosting service

## 🎯 Design Inspiration

This documentation is designed to be screenshot-worthy. The aesthetic matches high-end SaaS documentation with:

- Modern glassmorphism
- Smooth gradient accents
- Thoughtful typography
- Delightful micro-interactions
- Professional color palette

Perfect for showcasing OMNISKILL's design excellence!
