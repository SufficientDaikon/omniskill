## How Pipelines Work

Pipelines define ordered sequences of agent steps. Each step:

1. Receives input (from the user or a previous step)
2. Invokes a specific agent
3. Produces output passed to the next step
4. Handles failure (halt, loop back, skip, or retry)

Pipelines are **resumable** — if interrupted, they save state and can continue from the last completed step.

## Schema

See [`schemas/pipeline.schema.yaml`](../schemas/pipeline.schema.yaml) for the full pipeline definition schema.
